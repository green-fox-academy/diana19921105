                            The series takes place primarily in the fictional benthic underwater city of Bikini Bottom located in
                            the Pacific Ocean beneath the real-life coral reef known as Bikini Atoll. Its citizens
                            are mostly multicolored fish who live in buildings made from ship funnels and use "boatmobiles",
                            amalgamations of cars and boats, as a mode of transportation. Recurring locations within Bikini Bottom
                            include the neighboring houses of SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward; two competing restaurants, the
                            Krusty Krab and the Chum Bucket; Mrs. Puff's Boating School, which includes a driving course and a
                            sunken lighthouse; the Treedome, an oxygenated glass enclosure where Sandy lives; Shady Shoals Rest
                            Home; a seagrass meadow called Jellyfish Fields; and Goo Lagoon, a subaqueous brine pool that is a
                            popular beach hangout.
